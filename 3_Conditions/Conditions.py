Conditions are useful if we need to skip the program execution and move to 
other parts of the code if a condition is met or otherwise.

if <>

elsif <>

else

num = int(input("Enter a number:"))

if num == 10:
    print(f"The number is equals to {num}")    
elif num > 10:
    print(f"The number is greater than 10")
else:
    print(f"The number is neither equals nor greater than 10")
